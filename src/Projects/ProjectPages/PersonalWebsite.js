And by mocking up the layout of the Projects section in Figma before writing any code for it, I was able to come up with an informative and clean layout.",

Instead of sticking with a commonly used minimalist style, I decided to use a mountain and nature-themed design because I love the outdoors and I felt it was more unique to my personality. However, I struggled with deciding on a color palette. I wanted something that could easily work with consistent primary and secondary colors throughout the website but also needed something that wouldn’t clash with a variety of content either. I started with a purple-based color scheme because it is my favorite color and, after trying several combinations, decided on a palette that I liked. When I finished the first draft of the website, I found that the original colors felt too dark and gloomy. After another iteration of color combinations I came up with a brighter version of the original colors. I’ve found that this new palette is muted enough to work well with other colors but bright enough to feel lively."

Instead of getting ahead of myself and rushing through it, I decided to start by mocking up the layout in Figma before coding. I then spent a lot of time trying different layouts and iteratively adding sections of information to see how it would fit with the current idea. It took me longer to figure out something that worked than I anticipated but I’m glad I spent the time working on it in Figma rather than wasting time writing and rewriting code. After I decided on a layout that I liked, I mocked out the pages for each project so that when it came to the development step, I didn’t have to worry about anything other than getting the components to sit correctly on the page."
