                    "The goal of this project was to build a website for users to view more detailed information and statistics about their NY Times Crossword Puzzle data. This was a personal project inspired by my love of doing the NY Times Crossword Puzzle and my frustrations with the NY Timesâ€™ lack of available data and statistics.",
                    "One of the challenges for this project was figuring out how to implement a back end without an official API from the NY Times. I found that the lack of an official API required too many workarounds to make the project feasible. Although I did build a full back end, I ultimately decided to pare back the entire project to just a demo version so that I could focus on designing the front end. This demo version is viewable at the link provided and the github repo for it is puzzle-stats-demo. The full back end version of the code resides in the github repo puzzle-stats-hard-mode.",
                    "I built the initial back end for this application using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for the unofficial API. I also utilized AWS Amplify to implement a database with AppSync and user authentication with Cognito. I built the front-end using React and Material UI and used Nivo for the graphing capabilities. The website itself is hosted using an AWS Amplify project.",
